Receipt$ave

Have you ever been in a situation where you don’t know how much you are spending a month? We are going to solve this problem.
For this capstone project, our group is creating a mobile application to help organize your receipts to track what you spend. 
Take a photo of the receipt to help you organize your household items in the application. 
Also, the app will suggest simple recipes for what to make with the items you currently have.

The objective of this mobile app is to help people save time and stress when it comes tracking how much you spend a month. 
By having all your receipts, you won’t have to worry about how much you spent. Many people have to worry about having a budget for groceries,
and this app will help ease that stress level. This project is significant because it will help people be less stressed out 
about money and allows people to have one more asset available to help them keep track of their money.
